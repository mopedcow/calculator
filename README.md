TOP project "Calculator"

Finishing up this project for now..

- I did not complete the extra credit option to add keyboard support;
    I looked up  some examples and am afraid it would require re-writing my code
    extensively and i'm too tired lol (perhaps i will re-visit later for practice)
- I noticed that the AC button sometimes causes the display to become blank (no 0)
- small annoyance where a large number overlaps the display. this came about while
    i was playing with the css. just needs some tweaking. maybe later, again.
